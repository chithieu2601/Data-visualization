## Notes

This assignment is designed to teach you the basics of using space-partitioning to representing hierarchical data. Specific objectives include:

Implementing a treemap view suitable for visualizing data hierarchies using containment
Practicing implementing tree traversals in Javascript to compute geometric representations.
Experimenting with visual encoding for treemaps
Understanding the relationships and limitations of using size and area to encode hierarchies.
Further practice in d3, particularly on computing and setting properties for rectangles.

## Included files

* index.html:Structure the content of web pages showing results of a08.js with the button to change plots
* a08.js: This file is the basic treemapping heuristic draws a tree by progressively splitting a rectangle along vertical and horizontal lines such that the areas of the rectangles correspond to the weights of the subtrees
* flares.js: -The data used in the project
