## Notes
This assignment is designed to provide additional practice with more advanced uses of brushes and callback handlers in d3. Specific objectives include:

Implementing a parallel coordinates view suitable for viewing multi-dimensional datasets
Experimenting with using SVG path types for drawing polylines.
Practicing interactions with a parallel coordinates plot, particularly through implementing click events for selection and d3.brush’s for brushing and linking.
Designing callback handlers that support the above interactions of selection and filtering
Understanding the types of tasks that parallel coordinates are suitable for.


## Included files
a07.js: This file is used to create interactive plots with brushes and callback handlers
penguins.js: -The data used in the project
index.html: -Structure the content of web pages showing results of a07.js
