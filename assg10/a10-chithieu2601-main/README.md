## Notes

This assignment is designed to teach more advanced scalar field visualization through understanding how transfer functions work, utilizing a mapping from data values to optical properties. Specific objectives include:

Utilizing transfer functions to specify the input to a volume renderer.
Implementing an interface to specify transfer functions using d3.js.
Understanding how interacting with a transfer function can be used to investigate volumetric data.
Experimenting with your designed transfer functions to investigate three-dimensional scalar fields.

## Included files

* a10.js: Implentation for three different color transfer functions and the plots.
* index.html: Performing the plot as a web with teh buttons to change colors
