## Notes
I use most code from assignment 3 actually and I just change the name of the value and the function name. However, sometime it works and sometime the code doesn't, which make me very confused
Update 10/02/2025 12:22:  The calvinScores.js have never worked for me, I have to use scores.js

## Included files

* File 1 - a04.js:
* It helps generate one visualization that allows to interactively investigate the Calvin college dataset through multiple views. This will combine elements of the last two previous assignments, but leverage new features in d3 so as to make for more effective visualizations.

The scatterplot visualization of the Calvin college dataset where:

SATV is used to define the x-coordinate
ACT is used to define the y-coordinate
SATM is used to define the radius
GPA is used to define the color.

The button will change the color with the default style is colorscale 1
