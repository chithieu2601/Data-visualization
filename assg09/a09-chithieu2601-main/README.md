## Notes

This assignment is basics of scalar field visualization through combinations of geometric features (isocontours) and color mapping. Specific objectives include:

Implementing the marching squares algorithm for extracting isocontours in a piecewise manner.
Utilizing a case-table structure to maintain repeated computational structure and develop the algorithm in a compact way
Further practice in using SVG paths and d3’s features for constructing them
Experimenting with visual encoding of scalar fields utilizing both isocontour outlines and filled isocontours.

## Included files

* index.html: Structure the content of web pages showing results of a09.js with the button to change plots
* a09.js: This file's draw will be based on the collection of four values stored in the four corners (northwest (NW), northeast (NE), southwest (SW), and southeast (SE) of the cell, rather than just drawing each data value as one square
* data.js: -The data used in the project
