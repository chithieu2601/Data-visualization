## Notes
This assignment is designed to get comfortable with brushes and linked views in d3. Specific objectives include:
Practicing the design of multiple views visualizations
Learning how to define interactions in d3, particularly through implementing click events for selection and d3.brush’s for brushing and linking.
Experimenting with d3 brush callbacks for both types of events
Practicing the use of d3 filters for capturing selected data objects
Understanding how to compose all of the above skills to create an interactive visualization that allows for overview and details-on-demand

The implementation is added in a06.js from professor Joshua's skeleton

## Included files
