## Notes

Since I only implement 3 color function in a05.js so I won't say anything about teh other files

## Included files

* File 1 - a05.js (colorT1, colorT2, colorP3, colorPT4)
  This function helps visualize Temperature(T1, T2, PT4) and pressure (P3, PT4)
  with minimum and maximum value of temperature and boudaries for pressure (highest value of max and min actual value)
